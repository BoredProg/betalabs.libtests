#INSTA_P5_Libraries#
This is my version of the libraries folder.

All the samples of Processing and NetBeans rely on the fact these libraries are present and up to date.

The best idea is to clone them, then keep synchronised with the 'master' branch, so every change I make to my libraries (adding new libs, new examples, deleting libs, modifying examples, etc) will be reflected in this repository.
